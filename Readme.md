# Satisfaction Prediction of Customers using Airline Services
The airline is interested in predicting whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience. The airline would like you to construct and evaluate a model that can accomplish this goal. Specifically, they are interested in knowing which features are most important to customer satisfaction. The data for this activity includes survey responses from 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. A decision tree was modelled to predict whether or not a customer will be satisfied with their flight experience.

The data set is provided in [Customer_survey.csv](Customer_Survey.csv).<br>
